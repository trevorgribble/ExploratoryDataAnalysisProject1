## Project 1 for Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Course

We were asked to create 4 different plots based upon the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” from the UCI Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

The original dataset is too large for this github repository but it can be downloaded from the UCI Web Site at: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption)

There are four different R scripts included in this repository, `plot1.r`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, and  `plot4.R` 

Each one reads in the data from the `"household_power_consumption.txt"` file, performs analysis on the dataframe according to specifications, and then plots a corresponding `.png` file.

These 4 files, titled `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png` and `plot4.png` can be compared to the 4 files in Professor Peng's Github Repository in order to prove accuracy at: [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)
